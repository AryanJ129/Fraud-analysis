Objective:
Develop and implement an anomaly detection system to identify unusual patterns or behaviors within a given dataset. The goal is to enhance data integrity and provide actionable insights for decision-making processes.

Key Components:

    Data Collection and Preprocessing:
        Gathered relevant datasets required for anomaly detection.
        Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure high-quality input for the analysis.
        Utilized Python libraries such as pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Conducted thorough EDA to understand the underlying patterns and distributions within the data.
        Visualized data using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to identify initial trends and potential anomalies.

    Anomaly Detection Techniques:
        Implemented various anomaly detection algorithms, focusing on techniques suitable for time series data.
        Employed the ADTK (Anomaly Detection ToolKit) package for its robust functionalities in anomaly detection.
        Evaluated the performance of different algorithms to select the most effective approach for the dataset.

    Implementation and Results:
        Developed a pipeline to automate the anomaly detection process.
        Applied the selected algorithm to identify anomalies within the dataset.
        Visualized the detected anomalies and validated the results against expected outcomes to ensure accuracy.

    Reporting and Documentation:
        Documented the entire process, including data preprocessing steps, algorithm selection rationale, and results interpretation.
        Created a comprehensive report summarizing findings and providing recommendations based on the detected anomalies.

Technologies Used:

    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries and Tools: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, ADTK
